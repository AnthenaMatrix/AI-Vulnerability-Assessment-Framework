# AI Vulnerability Assessment Framework

The AI Vulnerability Assessment Framework is an open-source checklist designed to guide users through the process of assessing the vulnerability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems to various types of attacks and security threats. It provides a structured approach for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating vulnerabilities in AI models and systems, focusing on prompt injection attacks and related techniques.

## Checklist Items

1. **Vulnerability Identification**
   - [ ] Analyze model architecture for potential vulnerabilities.
   - [ ] Identify sensitive areas of the model susceptible to prompt manipulation.
   - [ ] Review model inputs and outputs for security implications.

2. **Attack Surface Analysis**
   - [ ] Assess the attack surface of the AI system, including data inputs, model parameters, and output interfaces.
   - [ ] Identify potential attack vectors and entry points for malicious input.

3. **Threat Modeling**
   - [ ] Create a threat model for the AI system, outlining potential security risks and attack scenarios.
   - [ ] Prioritize threats based on their likelihood and impact on system security.

4. **Prompt Injection Testing**
   - [ ] Generate adversarial prompts designed to manipulate model behavior.
   - [ ] Inject prompts into the AI system and observe the impact on model outputs.
   - [ ] Evaluate the effectiveness of prompt injection techniques in bypassing security controls.

5. **Security Assessment Reports**
   - [ ] Document identified vulnerabilities, including their severity and potential impact on system security.
   - [ ] Recommend mitigation strategies for addressing identified vulnerabilities.
   - [ ] Generate a comprehensive security assessment report summarizing findings and recommendations.

6. **Integration with Existing Tools**
   - [ ] Integrate the checklist with existing AI development and testing tools for seamless workflow integration.
   - [ ] Provide support for popular AI frameworks and platforms to facilitate vulnerability assessment.

7. **Community Collaboration**
   - [ ] Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing among researchers, practitioners, and security professionals.
   - [ ] Solicit feedback and contributions from the community to improve the effectiveness and coverage of the checklist.

## How to Use

- Use this checklist as a guide for assessing the security of AI systems against prompt injection attacks and related threats.
- Check off items as you complete them, ensuring thorough coverage of vulnerability assessment activities.
- Adapt the checklist to suit the specific requirements and context of your AI security assessments.
